            <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                 displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
                 and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
            <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
                 into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally 
                 included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
                 <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects
                      such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create 
                      structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
                       links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
                        Tags such as <code>&lt;img /&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;input /&gt;</code> directly introduce content into the page.
                         Other tags such as <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
                             surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
                              Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

                <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, 
                    a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo
                     proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser
                      and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert
                       Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted
                        by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext
                         is used" and put an encyclopedia first.</p>

            <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes),
                 character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like
                 <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example
                 <code> &lt;img&gt;</code>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called 
                 opening tags and closing tags).</p>
                 <p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:</p>
                 <code><div class="code"><pre>
                     
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
                    </pre></div></code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Semantic_HTML">
            <header><h1>Semantic HTML</h1></header>
            <p>Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of the encoded information
                over its presentation (look). HTML has included semantic markup from its inception,
                but has also included presentational markup, such as &lt;font&gt;, &lt;i&gt; and &lt;center&gt;
                tags. There are also the semantically neutral span and div tags. Since the late 1990s, when Cascading
                Style Sheets were beginning to work in most browsers, web authors have been encouraged to avoid the use 
                of presentational HTML markup with a view to the separation of presentation and content.</p>
                <p>In a 2001 discussion of the Semantic Web, Tim Berners-Lee and others gave examples of ways 
                    in which intelligent software "agents" may one day automatically crawl the web and find, 
                    filter and correlate previously unrelated, published facts for the benefit of human users.
                    Such agents are not commonplace even now, but some of the ideas of Web 2.0, mashups and price 
                    comparison websites may be coming close. The main difference between these web application hybrids 
                    and Berners-Lee's semantic agents lies in the fact that the current aggregation and hybridization 
                    of information is usually designed in by web developers, who already know the web locations and the 
                    API semantics of the specific data they wish to mash, compare and combine.</p>

                <section class="main-section" id="HTML4_variations">
                <header><h1>HTML4 variations</h1></header>
                <p>Since its inception, HTML and its associated protocols gained acceptance relatively quickly.
                     However, no clear standards existed in the early years of the language. Though its creators originally 
                     conceived of HTML as a semantic language devoid of presentation details, practical uses pushed many
                      presentational elements and attributes into the language, driven largely by the various browser vendors.
                       The latest standards surrounding HTML reflect efforts to overcome the sometimes chaotic development of 
                       the language and to create a rational foundation for building both meaningful and well-presented documents.
                        To return HTML to its role as a semantic language, the W3C has developed style languages such as CSS and XSL
                         to shoulder the burden of presentation. In conjunction, the HTML specification has slowly reined in the
                          presentational elements.</p>

                    <p>There are two axes differentiating various variations of HTML as currently specified:
                         SGML-based HTML versus XML-based HTML (referred to as XHTML) on one axis, and strict
                          versus transitional (loose) versus frameset on the other axis.</p>
